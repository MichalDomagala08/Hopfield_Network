# Hopfield Network
Repository with simple Hopfield Network both in form of Notebook and python written script.

**Program purpose**

Network can remember 3 different images (in form of star drawings)  of numbers: 1, 2, 3. Then, on by feeding the network incomplete matrixes that represent corrupted images of learned numbers, network reconstruct images and outputs  complete image that was saved in its memory. Purpose of this progamm is to simply visualize inner workings of Hopfield Network. By no mean it is a comprehensive method to learn,input and predict with Hopfield Network model.

**Files**

+ Hopfield_net.py --> programm that realises previously mentioned objectivei n a form of a script
+ SieÄ‡ Hopfielda.ipynb --> notebook with functions and codes that can generate hopfield network. This is an alternative to above mentioned script
+  Siec_Hopfielda.pdf --> a short paper on inner workings of Hopfield Network
